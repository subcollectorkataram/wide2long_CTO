The logic of the final Python code is to transform data from a wide format, where a single row contains all data for a farmer and their multiple plots, into a long format, where each row represents a single plot for a single farmer. This process is often called **unpivoting**.

***

### 1. Function Definition and Initial Setup

The core logic is encapsulated in the `transform_wide_to_long(df)` function. It takes a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) as input. The first step is to identify two types of columns:

* **Static Columns**: These columns contain information that is consistent for the entire farmer record, regardless of the number of plots (e.g., `farmer_name`, `village_name`, `phone_number`). A list called `static_cols` is created to hold these column names.
* **Repeating Columns**: These columns contain data specific to each plot and have a numbered suffix (e.g., `w3w_link_1`, `w3w_link_2`). The code dynamically finds the maximum number of plots by iterating through the column names and identifying the highest number suffix on a key column like `this_plot_id_X`. This makes the code flexible, as it doesn't need to be hard-coded for a specific number of plots.

### 2. The Unpivoting Loop

The transformation happens through a nested loop structure:

* **Outer Loop**: The code iterates through each row of the original `df_wide` DataFrame, using `df.iterrows()`. Each row represents a single farmer.
* **Inner Loop**: For each farmer's row, the code iterates through the range of plot numbers (from 1 up to `max_plots`). The loop variable `i` represents the current plot number being processed.

Inside the inner loop, a crucial check is performed: `if pd.notna(row.get(plot_id_col))`. This checks if a value exists for the plot ID of the current plot number. If the value is not missing (i.e., the farmer has a plot with that ID), the code proceeds to create a new row for the output DataFrame. This check prevents creating empty rows for plots that don't exist for a given farmer.

### 3. Populating the New Row

If a valid plot is found, a new dictionary called `new_row` is created. This dictionary will become a single row in the final, long-format DataFrame. The `new_row` is populated in three steps:

* **Static Data**: All values from the `static_cols` list are copied directly from the current wide-format row into the `new_row` dictionary.
* **Plot Data**: The code iterates through a list of plot-specific column patterns (e.g., `w3w_link`). For each pattern, it constructs the full column name with the current plot number suffix (e.g., `w3w_link_1`). It then retrieves the value from the wide-format row and assigns it to the `new_row` using the simplified column name (e.g., `w3w_link`).
* **Pipe Data**: A similar process is followed for the pipe-related columns, which also have a numbered suffix. The data is pulled from the wide-format row and added to the `new_row` dictionary using the simplified column names (e.g., `c1_pipe_status`).

After all the data for the current plot has been gathered, the `new_row` dictionary is appended to the `long_data` list.

### 4. Creating and Displaying the Final DataFrame

Once the loops are complete, the `long_data` list contains a collection of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a transformed row. `pd.DataFrame(long_data)` is then used to convert this list of dictionaries into the final, long-format DataFrame.

For the Streamlit app specifically, this final DataFrame is then displayed to the user using `st.dataframe()`, and a download button is generated using `st.download_button()` that allows the user to save the new CSV file. This provides a user-friendly interface for the entire transformation process.
